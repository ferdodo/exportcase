Opinionated file name validator for TypeScript.

## Features

- Enforces typescript file name based on ESM exports.
- Support TSX files.
- Zero config.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev exportcase
```

## Usage

```bash
exportcase check ./src
```

## Validation Rules

- **One named export per file**: Each file must have at most one named export.
- **File name must match the export**: The file name (without extension) must match the name of the single named export or the default export.
- **Star exports are only allowed in index files**: `export * from ...` is only allowed in files named `index.ts`.
